# KNN
Create a KNN model that shows the highest accuracy. Python is the only language used in this project
and the libraries used throughout are pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikitlearn. The goal throughout
the project is to tune the model for the highest accuracy by using the elbow method to get the optimal 
K value, which was 38. With K=38, the accuracy of the model is 84%. The starter K=1 produced an accuracy of 
75%. So by using the elbow method to find the best K value accuracy of the model was increased by 9%.
